# Basic-Calculator
# C Projects for Beginners

This repository contains two simple C language projects built as part of early programming practice. These projects demonstrate basic understanding of data structures, control flow, and user input/output handling.

##Projects Included

### 1.Basic Calculator using C and Stack (DSA)
A command-line calculator that performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using the stack data structure for postfix expression evaluation.

####Features:
- Evaluates expressions in postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) format.
- Uses stack for operand management.
- Basic implementation of expression parsing.
  
####Example:
Input: `23+`  
Output: `2.00 + 3.00 = 5.00`

### 2.Currency Converter using C
A simple currency converter that uses control flow statements (if-else and switch-case) to convert between different currencies using hardcoded exchange rates.

####Features:
- Converts between INR, USD, and EUR.
- Uses `switch-case` for user selection and conversion logic.
- Beginner-friendly example of conditionals and user input handling.
